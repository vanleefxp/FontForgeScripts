# FontForgeScripts

This repository contains a collection of FontForge scripts created by me.

To run the scripts, you need to put the parent directory of FontForge's executable file into your system's environmental variables to ensure that you can invoke FontForge directly by the `fontforge` command in command line. Then click on the `run.bat` file in each folder to run the scripts.
